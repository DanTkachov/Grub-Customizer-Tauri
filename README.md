# Grub Customizer

This is my version of a grub customizer built with the intention to allow users to swap themes easily and quickly.
Requires "sudo" to run properly 
To-Do:
- Add a "No theme" option
- Render Thumbnails for themes properly (Currently unfinished)
- Add a small banner to depict which theme is currently selected for the user (currently using a green border around the theme)
- Add the ability to set wallpapers instead of a whole theme
